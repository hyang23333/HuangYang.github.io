### Bio
---
My name is Yang Huang, a junior year undergraduate student with GPA 3.81/4.00, majoring in Communication and Computer Science at School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University. I joined the Character Shape Computing Laboratory [CSCL](http://59.108.48.27/cscl/) of the Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University since February, following [Zhouhui Lian](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/zlian/) since 2018. I am trying to explore topics about Computer Graphics and Signal and Image processing.

### Project Experience 
---
* **Non-Rigid 3D Shaperetrieval Based on Points Cloud Neural Network (Mentor: Zhouhui LIAN)  04/2019- Ongoing**    
 ➢ Developed a new large-scale 3D model point cloud dataset based on 3Dmax and Meshlab and provided multiple data formats.  
 ➢ Designed and trained a new network module for extracting features of non-rigid 3D models based on their posture-invariance and rotation-invariance.  
 ➢ Built a platform for retrieval of 3D models and provided the evaluation methods of different retrieval methods; combined the characteristics of geometric with the point neural network to analyze the main features and achieved efficient retrieval/classification results.

* **Design of a Low-rank Convolutional Neural Networks (Mentor: Zhouhui LIAN) 06/2019- 09/2019**   
 ➢ Designed a low-rank point cloud convolutional neural networks in python to achieve plugin and play for image quality improvement, noise reduction, and the reduction of contour contortion.   
 ➢ Implemented the tests on several SOTA models and data sets: acades, cityscapes, improving the quality of the low frequency part and significantly lower the FIDscore.  
Next:  
 ➢ Balance the low-rank component and sparse part on high resolution atlas with less loss of high frequency detail in images.   
 ➢ Conduct the experience on the coarse to fine network; respectively generated the low-frequency contour and realistic details; observe the quality of the low resolution part and verify its feasibility as high resolution pictures.

* **Heterogeneous Face Recognition: Multi-model Fusion and Siamese Network 05/2019- 011/2019**   
 ➢ Aimed to advance the efficiency of the heterogeneous face recognition in capturing the common features of images.  
 ➢ Designed an end-to-end network with fused neural networks to extract face features, improving the identification ability of the model; adopted the Pseudo-Siamese Network, integrated contrastive loss and binary cross entropy loss to complete the identification work.  
 ➢ Applied the Caricature-Visual dataset which well-performed on identifying unseen images of people in datasets, and work well on identifying new images of people that are not included in the dataset.

* **Research on Shooting Compilation Clipping Method of Football Match Videos 03/2019-03/2020**   
 ➢ Developed a program which could upload unprocessed fixed-view panoramic videos of the same field through a visual interface, auto- compilations.    
 ➢ Carried out pre-processing modeling and deblurring based on background priori information to separate moving object from original background, then used the algorithm to extract current frame position and trajectory of the football.    
 ➢ Utilized frame difference method and background difference method to conduct experiments and make adjustments, so that the soccer under panoramic video could be accurately identified from a large number of targets, and implemented the experimental exploration on the generated class model and discriminant class mode.    
 ➢ Took into consideration the characteristics of soccer and players in football matches to improve the algorithm based on OpenCV and Visual Studio experiments and seek the optimal solution for football trajectory tracking.
